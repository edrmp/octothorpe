`octothorpe`
------------

`octothorpe` is a [Twisted][1] interface to the [Asterisk Manager
Interface][2].

At the moment, `octothorpe` is still in early development, though
I intend it to eventually offer full asynchronous AGI functionality.

Because of this, I cannot at this time offer API stability, but that
is definitely in the cards for the first (0.1?) release.
